# 🚀 Research Roadmap — WebAssembly Across the Computational Continuum (IoTinuum)

This project investigates WebAssembly (WASM) as a **unified execution layer across the entire Computational Continuum (Edge–Fog–Cloud)**.

Instead of restricting WASM to embedded devices, this research evaluates the feasibility, portability, performance, and security implications of deploying the same WebAssembly modules across heterogeneous nodes.

# 🎯 Research Hypothesis

WebAssembly can act as a lightweight, secure, and portable execution layer capable of unifying distributed IoT application logic across Edge, Fog, and Cloud environments.
